# `Stream Swap sim`

Simulations of the StreamSwap invariant compared to Curve's reference implementation.

## Background

The StreamSwap program is built to be faithful to Curve's Swap invariant. This package contains a simulator which ensures that the output of the StreamSwap Rust code is equivalent to that of Curve's Python reference implementation.

## Documentation

Detailed information on how to build on Stream Protocol can be found on the [Stream ProtocolÂ´s Swap developer documentation website](https://docs.streamprotocol.org/docs/swap/developing/overview).
